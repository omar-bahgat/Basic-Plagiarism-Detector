Although quantum computing has shown its potential and effectiveness in solving massive problems, it faces major obstacles that may slow down the development of quantum computers. One such obstacle is that current super quantum computers have a maximum of 50 quibts and the some of the applications that scientists aim to achieve would require at least 1000 quibts. Another obstacle would be the near absolute zero-Kelvin temperatures the hardware components of quantum computer would need to be contained in. It is essential to obtain near absolute zero-Kelvin temperature in order to have error free qubit operations. Not only that but qubits require an isolated area since they are vulnerable to both electric and magnetic fields. As a result, enormous regions and materials are needed to assist in separating them evenly and properly at 0-kelvin temperature. Knill, E. (2010). Moreover, quantum computing needs a hybrid system to operate, unlike classical computers that use the traditional software systems. Regarding this problem, the author Garcia-Alonso - from the Quantum Software as a Service Through a Quantum API Gateway article - introduces a prototype of the hybrid systems (Alonso, 2022). This hybrid system involves a decision based tool that indicates which quantum machine should be used for the task assessed. There is currently a hybrid system prototype under development that gathers previous executions created by multiple users in order to enhance the prototype. Quantum computing is said to solve complex problems at a drastically shorter time than classical computers due to qubits having the ability to acquire both states 0 and 1 simultaneously which decreases the number of computations by a huge factor. However, this also poses a massive risk to the current encryption techniques used to protect most of the systems in the world.
