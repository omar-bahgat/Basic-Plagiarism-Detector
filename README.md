# Basic-Plagiarism-Detector
Created a basic plagiarism detector that treats each sentence in a test file as a potential pattern and searches for a match in a set of documents, calculating overall plagiarism percentage and the documents from which the test file was plagiarized from. Used Knuth-Morris-Pratt, Rabin-Karp, and Boyer-Moore algorithms for the string matching process.
