Quantum computing is the computational science that uses the principles of quantum mechanics to execute certain calculations. A quantum computer stores its data in units known as qubits which are the counterparts of a bit in classical computers. However, qubits can use superposition to achieve the two states of 0 and 1 simultaneously, unlike classical computers that use bits to either acquire the state of 0 or 1 but not both. The concept of quantum computers was first introduced by Richard Feynman and Yuri Manin in the 1980s. Feynman, an American physicist, and Manin, a Russian mathematician, introduced a simple model to build a quantum computer that was later developed throughout the years. Quantum computing is said to solve complex problems at a drastically shorter time than classical computers due to qubits having the ability to acquire both states 0 and 1 simultaneously which decreases the number of computations by a huge factor. However, this also poses a massive risk to the current encryption techniques used to protect most of the systems in the world. Quantum computers have the potential to crack encryption in a matter of minutes that would otherwise take hundreds of years to crack using supercomputers.
